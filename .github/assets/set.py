#This is how you create an empty set
s = set()

'''
set is more than just a string
not a database yet
set is like a tiny database
Tons of set make up a database
'''
#and this is how you add elements to the set:
s.add(1)
'''
set TAKE EXACTLY ONE ARGUMENT
'''
#s.add(2,3)
s.add(2)

#This is how you print and view the contents of the set that you've add into.

print(s)
